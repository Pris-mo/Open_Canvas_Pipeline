# **Install Docker**

This project runs inside **Docker**, which is a tool that lets you run software in a self-contained environment.

Think of Docker like a lightweight virtual machine: it bundles the app and everything it needs (libraries, dependencies, system tools) so you don’t have to manually install and configure all of that yourself. It helps make sure the project runs the same way on every computer.

### **How to install Docker**

There are two main ways to install it:

* **Recommended (easiest):** Install **Docker Desktop**  
   \- [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)  
   This includes everything you need and works well for most users.

* **Advanced (command line only):**  
  \-  [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)  
  This is typically used on Linux systems or servers.

After installation, make sure Docker is running before continuing to the next steps.
