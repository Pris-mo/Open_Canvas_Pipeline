# **Get Your OpenAI API Key (Optional)**

If you’d like to use OpenAI models (such as GPT-5-class models) inside the application, you’ll need an **OpenAI API key**.

An API key allows this application to securely send requests to OpenAI’s servers on your behalf. It does **not** share your password.

⚠️ This step is optional, but strongly recommended for new Open WebUI users. Adding an OpenAI API key enables higher-quality content retrieval and automatically makes OpenAI models available in your Open WebUI instance.

## **Add Prepaid Billing to Your OpenAI Account**

### **Recommendation**

When adding prepaid credits:

* Start with the **lowest available amount**

* Monitor usage in your OpenAI dashboard

* Increase only if needed

For typical experimentation and course use, small balances often last a long time.
